Rinzai
======

The goal of Rinzai is to allow teachers to create coding tests that test all three web languages, not only for how the code works, but also checks how it's written. To do this it combines node modules for style checking, linting, abstract syntax tree parsing; combined it with unit testing; all in a browser friendly wrapper with a single API. With Rinzai you can test anything from whether the code works down to if the student used a hex code to set a background color. To see it in action check out the samples below:

Example Application (Rinzai is just the API for testing the solutions, the rest of the page is not part of the API):

* JavaScript: http://shiftyp.github.io/fewd6/exercises/?test=javascript
* CSS: http://shiftyp.github.io/fewd6/exercises/?test=css_basics
* HTML: http://shiftyp.github.io/fewd6/exercises/?test=html_basics
